    <h1> Was the forgotten borough forgotten again by Mamdani’s plan for a rent freeze? </h1>
    <!-- DEK/SUBHED -->
    <h3 class="intro">One of Mayoral Elect Zohran Mamdani’s main campaign promises was a rent freeze for stabilized units but that couldn’t move the needle for Staten Island – where he lost big and where there are less than 1% of the city’s stabilized units.</h3>
    <!-- BYLINE -->

    <!-- STORY STARTS HERE -->
    <p> One of New York City mayoral elect Zohran Mamdani’s main campaign promises was a <a href="https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform"target="blank">rent freeze for rent stabilized units</a> across all five boroughs, according to his campaign website. But one of the city’s five boroughs stands to gain very little from this proposal. </p>

    <!-- CHART GOES HERE (USE THE RESPONSIVE IFRAME EMBED CODE) -->
<iframe title="Percent of Total Rent Stabilized Housing by Borough" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Y6LEG" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Y6LEG/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="247" data-external="1"></iframe>

    <p>Staten Island is home to less than 1% of the city’s rent stabilized apartments, according to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey. This is significantly less than the other boroughs. Queens, for example, has the second smallest share of rent stabilized units but still has over 15% of the total number of units. </p>

    <p>This could be part of the reason Mamdani struggled to win over voters in NYC’s toughest borough for democrats. While Mamdani swept the New York City election, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/04/us/elections/results-new-york.html"target="blank">earning around 50% of the vote </a>in almost all boroughs, as reported by the New York Times, he received less than half of that in Staten Island, with only 23% of voters picking his name on the ballot. </p>

    <p>Since Mamdani’s election, whispers on Staten Island have even renewed ideas of secession from city government. Assemblymember Sam Pirozzolo held an event earlier this November, calling for Staten Island Independence. </p>
 
    <p>“Once again, we are being told to pay more, and expect less,” he said in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DQ5HC45D9l8/"target="blank">post</a> to his official Instagram account. He highlighted frustrations about Staten Island tax dollars leaving the island to support the greater city, insead of leaving them for “our schools, our roads and Staten Island families.”</p>

    <p>While Mamdani takes office this January, the potential rent freeze won’t take place until June. That’s when the Rent Guidelines Board votes to establish lease renewal guidelines for all of the rent stablized units in the city, which includes deciding <a href="https://rentguidelinesboard.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dutiesofrgb.pdf"target="blank">percentage increases in monthly rent.</a> As mayor, Mamdani can’t freeze rent on his own, he can only appoint members to the board who can do his bidding.</p>
